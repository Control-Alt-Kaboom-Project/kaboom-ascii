# Kaboom-ASCII

This is a public repository for referencing the ascii-art logos used in the alt-kaboom project documentation. 

```bash
   ____   _    _____  __  __   ____  _____  ____  ____  __  __ 
  / () \ | |__|_   _||  |/  / / () \ | () )/ () \/ () \|  \/  |
 /__/\__\|____| |_|  |__|\__\/__/\__\|_()_)\____/\____/|_|\/|_|
```

## Usage

At this time this is just a storage repo. Select the ascii-art type you want from the `.ascii` folder and copy/paste it into your documentation.

In the near future there will be a small form that will source the content into your clipboard, accessable through the kaboom-cli. Date for this release is yet to be determined.
